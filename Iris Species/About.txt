After finishing the Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng I took up on the well known #Iris dataset with the only aim of implementing a OneVsAll vectorized Logistic Regression model without the use of any python libraries but Numpy and #Pandas. I have used the Scipy library to use its fmincg function which returns the values of theta by optimizing the Cost function.
Grateful to Andrew Ng for helping me understand complete fundamental and mathematical aspects of algorithms like Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks and Logistic Regression and also showing how sometimes using vectorization in our machine leaning algorithm is the key to boost algorithm and save a huge amount of training time.
